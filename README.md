Micro Finance Public Initiatives

An android app that Self Help Groups can use for
their operations.

Banking on Change is a Barclays initiative in collaboration with Plan and Care organizations, 
aimed at improving the quality of lives of under-privileged people by improving access to basic financial services. 
One of their centers in India works in Delhi to help run all-women Self-Help Groups (SHGs) in Mongolpuri area in Delhi (similar to Micro-Finance organizations).

Current Scenario:
•	Manual Record keeping and aggregation
•	Data digitized at a very high level for reporting  via Excel

Proposal : Android application to be used by field officers to capture data and synchronize it with a central database.

Advantages
-	Enhance operational efficiency and make it audit ready.
-	Automation
-	Personnel profiles (SHG members) can be easily maintained, growth and impact can be closely monitored.
-	Improve computer literacy.
